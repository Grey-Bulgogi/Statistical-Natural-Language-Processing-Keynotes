### Dialog System

* A system to provide an interface between the user and a computer-based application
* Interact on a turn-by-turn basis
* Dialogue manager
    * Control the flow of the dialogue
    * Main flow
        * Information gathering from user
        * Communicating with external application
        * Communicating information back to the user
    * Three types of the dialogue system
        * frame-based
        * agent-based
        * finite-state- (or graph-) based

### Frame-based Approach

* Asks the user questions to fill slots in a template to perform a task (form-filling task)
* Recognizes the main concepts in the user's utterance

### Agent-based Approach

* Properties
    * Complex communication using unrestricted natural language
    * Mixed-Initiative
    * Co-operative problem solving
    * Conversational agents
* For example:
    1) User: I'm looking for a job in the Calais area. Are there any servers?
    2) System: No, there aren't any employment servers for Calais. However, there is an employment server for Pasde-Calais.

### VoiceXML-based System

* What is VoiceXML?
    * The HTML(XML) of the voice web.
    * Then open standard markup language for voice application
